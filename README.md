Adds a compiler derived from Composers Composer\Compiler class that creates a ppm.phar file for use
in other projects, isolating the php-pm dependencies from your project making it more portable.

Note: this library does not follow any versioning scheme.

This library includes:

 * httpkernel-adapter
 
Note: all other adapters have been removed as they are not updated very often.

In addition the following additional bootstrappers are included:

 * `SomnambulistSymfony`
 
   General bootstrapper for SF 5+ based projects that can handle the change in Kernel naming
   and the new public folder. **Note:** Kernel discovery requires the usage of PSR-4 naming
   conventions in your project and usage of the standard `./src` folder. If not found,
   `AppKernel` and `App\Kernel` will attempt to be used.

To use any of these Bootstrap classes, replace your bootstrap in the ppm.json with the class
name. They use the `PHPPM\Bootstrappers` namespace for autoloading.

### Compile Phar

Run: `./bin/compile` - a `ppm.phar` will be created in the root folder.

Copy the ppm.phar wherever you would like or symlink it: e.g.: `ln -s ./ppm.phar /usr/local/bin/ppm`

If you have specific version requirements, clone this package and set the versions you need.
